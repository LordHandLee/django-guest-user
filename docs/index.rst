A reusable `Django`_ app that allows site visitors to interact with your project
as if they were registered users without having to sign up first.

.. _Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/

By allowing anonymous guests to use all features of your page, the barrier to
entry is lowered and conversion rates for new users can increase. Visitors will
be more invested in your service and more likely to convert if they already made
progress using your application. Converting to a permanent user takes very few
clicks and allows visitors to save their progress and don't risk to lose it
once the guest users are cleaned up.

This project was largely inspired by `django-lazysignup`_ and rewritten for
modern Django and Python versions.
