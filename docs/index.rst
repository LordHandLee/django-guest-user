django-guest-user
=================

A reusable Django app that allows site visitors to interact with your Django
project as if they were registered users without having to sign up first.

By allowing anonymous guests to use all features of your page, the barrier to
entry is lowered and conversion rates for new users can increase. Converting
a guest user takes a few clicks and allows visitors to save their progress
and don't risk to lose it once the guest users are cleaned up.

This project was largely inspired by `django-lazysignup`_ and rewritten for
modern Django and Python versions.
